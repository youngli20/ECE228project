# ECE228 Project
## Modulation Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Our goal is to train a model to properly identify the modulation scheme used by wireless communication devices.

This repo will contain the code we used in our research and the research paper itself in pdf format.

Thank you for reading and enjoy!
